# Onboarding

As referenced in the primary README file, the following file has solid information on how to get started using PyScrabby: [sample_robot.py](/sample_robot.py).

```bash
python sample_robot.py
```

## Day 1

Day one is focused on just getting the simulator downloaded and onto your computer. First, visit [https://sim.soonerrobotics.org](https://sim.soonerrobotics.org) and download the simulator from there according to your platform. Always download the latest version, or whatever is selected by default. For Mac users, you will have to try and dual boot, run a VM, or use another computer. Due to some complications with how Apple signs applications, it is just a overly big hassle to get the simulator working on Mac. While we are working on it, I cannot promise a *working by date*.

Once you have it downloaded, your goal will be to select the *Onboarding Robot*, the *Onboarding* category, and the *Day 1* map. Then, you can try and run the [sample_robot.py](/sample_robot.py) code to verify that you can run the simulator on your computer! This is the end of Day 1. In person, we walked back to the lab and had everyone drive our old robot to get a feel for it, and also see our old UI.

## Day 2

On Day 2, you will focus on making your robot manuever between a variety of points using the setVelocity method using A* (or your favorite path planning algorithm). Below are the list of waypoints, as well as the algorithm to convert between the GPS lat/long to x/y.

### Points

 - (6, 5)
 - (11, 16)
 - (4, 26)
 - (-8, 20)
 - (-13, 6)

### GPS to X/Y

*WIP*
